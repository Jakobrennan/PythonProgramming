# Python Programming

Wanting to start getting involved with backend development which will involve
work with `algorithms`, `frameworks`, `lambda's`, `functional programming`,
`OOP`, etc... and the easiest language i've come across to understand these
consepts is Python

Not only that but Python is also a widely adopted language atm and i think it
would be good to understand it a little better
